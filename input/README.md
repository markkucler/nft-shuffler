## Folder Organization: Initial Files and Required Subfolders

Place your initial files into this folder. While the subfolders of this folder are not required to follow a specific naming convention, it is crucial that the folder or folders include both an `images` and a `metadata` folder, named exactly as specified. Also, ensure that both the `images` and `metadata` folders contain an equal number of files.

```shell
input/
├── batch1
│   ├── images
│   └── metadata
├── batch2
│   ├── images
│   └── metadata
└── batch3
    ├── images
    └── metadata
```

or

```shell
input/
└── folder
    ├── images
    └── metadata
```
